My name is Martin Ingram. I'm a PhD Student at the University of Melbourne,
Australia, supervised by [Nick
Golding](https://research.curtin.edu.au/researcher/nick-golding-fea4f81a/) and
[Damjan Vukcevic](http://damjan.vukcevic.net/). I completed my undergraduate degree in
Natural Sciences (Physical) at the Unversity of Cambridge in 2014 and a Master's
degree in Computing Science at Imperial College, supervised by [William
Knottenbelt](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.knottenbelt) in 2015.

I'm interested applying Bayesian statistics to practical problems. You can view
my publications on [Google
scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AZ-A7AEAAAAJ&hl=en).

My github account is here: [github](https://github.com/martiningram)

One current focus is on researching variational inference algorithms that are
both fast and accurate enough. I am doing some work on this using the JAX
package in python. Some code for this is in the [SVGP
repository](https://github.com/martiningram/svgp).
